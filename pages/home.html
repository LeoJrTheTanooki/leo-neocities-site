        Commissions Are Open For Business
      </h1>
      <div class="m-2">
        <p>
          Yup, it's official, I will create you things if you pay me. After
          waiting so long for some sort of call back from a variety of places, I
          decided to take financial matters of some form into my own hands. The
          Art and about Pages may be completely generic and barebones but
          goddamn did I deck the hell out my Commissions page. Then again with
          that I at least had a frame of reference in the form of my commission
          sheet, which that itself was an entire beast which i had to try and
          figure out with how ambitious yet big the gif size was. Like it's a
          work of art to me but too much of a work of art for other sites to
          handle (33MB) and not to mention even when I finally got the gif
          compressed enough to where it looked fine on the surface, it was
          indeed not fine when I sent it into Discord. I may have to make a new
          static version of the image in this case.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          As for the commissions themselves, I've honestly been wanting to do
          commissions for a while now but I've never had the reach nor the
          experience necessary to tackle such things until now. Not only that
          but the number is also growing at a steady pace the more I casually
          post my art and shitposts. It... makes me feel seen y'know... like
          these cool people I look up to, I'm technically among those ranks.
          Nowhere near as big but every now and then I'll see some relatively
          big artist like one of my art pieces so I at least know I have my foot
          in the door with the community as a whole. Who knew that simply
          participating in online art spaces would get you some sort of notice.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Speaking of online spaces though, I actually recently reached a 300
          follower count milestone on Bluesky and I only noticed how close I was
          just a few days ago. So of course we have to celebrate this sort of
          occassion. I'm going to do a raffle... at some point idk just yet.
          Listen I'm still pretty new here and I need to get some stuff worked
          out first, but I do want to do a raffle. I still have like eight more
          requests to do on top of two more potential projects on the horizon
          and on top of the usual life stuff, but I still want to do a raffle
          dammit, I want to get good at low poly models to where it becomes
          second nature to me. Because I know this has potential of some kind
          for someone like me.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          That aside, I've set a goal to start a raffle the day before the Half
          Off Sale ends, if not sooner... Oh yeah my commissions are starting a
          half the usual price until March 11th. so if you want a low poly model
          of yourself or your friend or anyone's OC for $15 at the least, please
          consider my deal. In general though I'm honestly just happy that I'm
          able to do low poly stuff in the first place... like... at all y'know?
          And if it gets me sime extra money so people can't totally say it's
          useless or futile, I'm doing what I love and I'm getting paid for it.
          That's all that matters to me. (Just saying though, I'm still hoping
          to get a tech job of some kind in the future, if you know any openings
          in the Pacific coast especially then please reach out like genuinely I
          am so tired of being ghosted all the freaking time in job application
          sites and even in person to an extent)
