          ...Welp, what was supposed to be a summary of what I've been up to
          turned into an entire vent. If you wanna hear me spill my load, look
          below. Anyhow, raffle never happened lol, may or may not try again
          idk. I'm gonna open commissions again soon though. I'm also joining

          this year. Gonna update the page too with the power of adderall by my
          side (What that update was originally gonna be about, got prescribed
          finally). Overall, things are better than before.

            To think I would use this more... alas, I once again had other
            things at hand to deal with. So I'm just going to say it, I've been
            put through the wringer mentally for the past couple of months. Low
            self image issues, failing to reach milestones at my age, inability
            to get a job, a constant feeling as if I was wasting my time and
            life. And the constant executive dysfunctional moments sure didn't
            do any sort of help whatsoever, in fact those moments that were
            frequent were the biggest plague upon my psyche as it was used as
            fuel to be further berated, making me feel like the biggest
            freeloader around which further fueled my own self pity and guilt
            which further went and fueled my depression which I had developed
            throughout my period of unemployment
            <span class="font-bold"
              >because a bright future in a career space that seemed like the
              only feasible job for me and my mind had eroded into nothing by
              the time I was ready to enter that career field and not even the
              minimum wage jobs around my area was answering me back at all,
              with my efforts to go in person as suggested leading to the same
              answers such as "We're hiring in a month or two or next season",
              or "Just check our website"
              <span class="italic">
                and the information that I was given being the fact that every
                applicant for those jobs are basically chosen by raffle and
                everywhere I looked online everyone else struggles with
                unemployment and ghost jobs sure didn't help me see any sort of
                light at all and in fact made me believe that I was caved in
                this miserable tunnel simply due to outside circumstances
                <span class="font-extrabold">
                  OH BUT IF ONLY I TRIED HARDER EARLIER IN MY LIFE AND IF ONLY I
                  LACKED MORALS SO I COULD PARTICIPATE INTO MONEY VENTURES LIKE
                  NFTS AND IF ONLY I DIDN'T HAVE AUTISM AND ADHD AND A
                  GIRLFRIEND IF ONLY I HAD ALL THAT INSTEAD OF STAYING IN MY
                  ROOM FOR HOURS AS I ATTEMPT TO FREELANCE OR ATTEMPT TO DO
                  COMMISSIONS FOR CASH ALL SO HE CAN SHUT THE HELL UP AND LEAVE
                  ME BE THEN I WOULDN'T BE IN THIS MESS IN THE FIRST PLACE AND
                  HAVE SOME CASH!!!

          <p>But now I'm all good! =3</p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Yeah I was... told a lot of things throughout the time, I may be
            overexaggerating things but almost no one contacted me back in spite
            of how much I could muster up the ability to try, I only got
            contacted thrice... ever... One turned out to be a scam that shut
            down my bank account cause I nearly fell for it like a dumbass, the
            other turned out to be a pyramid scheme with some health insurance
            thing and the last I just straight up bombed, all out of like 200
            jobs I applied to. I only lucked out with my current job simply
            because I arrived at the location at the right place at the right
            time and the boss recognized me from a party her daughter had hosted
            for the coding school we attended. I got it on the spot. It's more
            of an odd job where I help to run a game trailer to bookings just
            ensuring things run smoothly and resolve any issues that arise but
            everyone there including my bosses seem to like me... for who I
            am??? Genuinely a wild concept ay that point, yeah I know pretty sad
            that that of all things was wild to me but being called a freak
            strange p***y f****t weirdo dumbass r[EDACTED] sure didn't help even
            if he didn't mean it or was just "playing around" sure made me feel
            unlovable wow who would've thunk.
            <span class="line-through">
              To give credit where credit is due, he did help with getting an
              electric bike and fixing some things around the house and forced
              me to get out more which I did need, but still.
            </span>
            Nah screw that, after responding to a couple of questions he had
            about my future with "I don't know" which translates to "I know damn
            well you're gonna go and push me down with some negatively cynical
            bigoted ass crap that's still rooted in reality so I won't be able
            to argue back regardless if I give you a valid response so I'm not
            gonna say jack" and then threatening to kick me out of the house at
            25 (as if I could in this economy), I'm just gonna move in with my
            secondary support system when I learn to drive, even if it means
            I'll be living with less. I've done it for this past month already
            and they've been nothing but supportive to me, hell even when I was
            unemployed they've shown unconditional love and support, reminding
            me that I'm always welcome in their house no matter what.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            All that being said, I'm glad to have some new people to lean on,
            and the reminder that I'll always have a secondary support system
            should my primary one fall for any reason is nice. I've also been
            offered to work even further with my bosses beyond my current
            position in the company to do coding stuff so I think I'll stick
            around with them further to see what goes on. And even if that fails
            and the berating continues, then at least I'll have another support
            system that understands that things come at their own time rather
            than one that puts constant pressure with little encouragement.
