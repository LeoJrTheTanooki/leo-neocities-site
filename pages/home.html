              To think I would use this more... alas, I once again had other
              things at hand to deal with. So I'm just going to say it, I've
              been put through the wringer mentally for the past couple of
              months. Low self image issues, failing to reach milestones at my
              age, inability to get a job, a constant feeling as if I was
              wasting my time and life. And the constant executive dysfunctional
              moments sure didn't do any sort of help whatsoever, in fact those
              moments that were frequent were the biggest plague upon my psyche
              as it was used as fuel to be further berated, making me feel like
              the biggest freeloader around which further fueled my own self
              pity and guilt which further went and fueled my depression which I
              had developed throughout my period of unemployment
              <span class="font-bold"
                >because a bright future in a career space that seemed like the
                only feasible job for me and my mind had eroded into nothing by
                the time I was ready to enter that career field and not even the
                minimum wage jobs around my area was answering me back at all,
                with my efforts to go in person as suggested leading to the same
                answers such as "We're hiring in a month or two or next season",
                or "Just check our website"
                <span class="italic">
                  and the information that I was given being the fact that every
                  applicant for those jobs are basically chosen by raffle and
                  everywhere I looked online everyone else struggles with
                  unemployment and ghost jobs sure didn't help me see any sort
                  of light at all and in fact made me believe that I was caved
                  in this miserable tunnel simply due to outside circumstances
                  <span class="font-extrabold">
                    OH BUT IF ONLY I TRIED HARDER EARLIER IN MY LIFE AND IF ONLY
                    I LACKED MORALS SO I COULD PARTICIPATE INTO MONEY VENTURES
                    LIKE NFTS AND IF ONLY I DIDN'T HAVE AUTISM AND ADHD AND A

            <br />
            <p>
              Yeah I was... told a lot of things throughout the time, I may be
              overexaggerating things but almost no one contacted me back in
              spite of how much I could muster up the ability to try, I only got
              contacted thrice... ever... One turned out to be a scam that shut
              down my bank account cause I nearly fell for it like a dumbass,
              the other turned out to be a pyramid scheme with some health
              insurance thing and the last I just straight up bombed, all out of
              like 200 jobs I applied to. I only lucked out with my current job
              simply because I arrived at the location at the right place at the
              right time and the boss recognized me from a party her daughter
              had hosted for the coding school we attended. I got it on the
              spot. It's more of an odd job where I help to run a game trailer
              to bookings just ensuring things run smoothly and resolve any
              issues that arise but everyone there including my bosses seem to
              like me... for who I am??? Genuinely a wild concept ay that point,
              yeah I know pretty sad that that of all things was wild to me but
              being called a freak strange p***y f****t weirdo dumbass
              r[EDACTED] sure didn't help even if he didn't mean it or was just
              "playing around" sure made me feel unlovable wow who would've
              thunk.
              <span class="line-through">
                To give credit where credit is due, he did help with getting an
                electric bike and fixing some things around the house and forced
                me to get out more which I did need, but still.
              </span>
              Nah screw that, after responding to a couple of questions he had
              about my future with "I don't know" which translates to "I know
              damn well you're gonna go and push me down with some negatively
              cynical bigoted ass crap that's still rooted in reality so I won't
              be able to argue back regardless if I give you a valid response so
              I'm not gonna say jack" and then threatening to kick me out of the
              house at 25 (as if I could in this economy), I'm just gonna move
              in with my secondary support system when I learn to drive, even if
              it means I'll be living with less. I've done it for this past
              month already and they've been nothing but supportive to me, hell
              even when I was unemployed they've shown unconditional love and
              support, reminding me that I'm always welcome in their house no
              matter what.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              All that being said, I'm glad to have some new people to lean on,
              and the reminder that I'll always have a secondary support system
              should my primary one fall for any reason is nice. I've also been
              offered to work even further with my bosses beyond my current
              position in the company to do coding stuff so I think I'll stick
              around with them further to see what goes on. And even if that
              fails and the berating continues, then at least I'll have another
              support system that understands that things come at their own time
              rather than one that puts constant pressure with little
              encouragement.

          Commissions Are Open For Business
        </h1>
        <div class="m-2">
          <p>
            Yup, it's official, I will create you things if you pay me. After
            waiting so long for some sort of call back from a variety of places,
            I decided to take financial matters of some form into my own hands.
            The Art and about Pages may be completely generic and barebones but
            goddamn did I deck the hell out my Commissions page. Then again with
            that I at least had a frame of reference in the form of my
            commission sheet, which that itself was an entire beast which i had
            to try and figure out with how ambitious yet big the gif size was.
            Like it's a work of art to me but too much of a work of art for
            other sites to handle (33MB) and not to mention even when I finally
            got the gif compressed enough to where it looked fine on the
            surface, it was indeed not fine when I sent it into Discord. I may
            have to make a new static version of the image in this case.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            As for the commissions themselves, I've honestly been wanting to do
            commissions for a while now but I've never had the reach nor the
            experience necessary to tackle such things until now. Not only that
            but the number is also growing at a steady pace the more I casually
            post my art and shitposts. It... makes me feel seen y'know... like
            these cool people I look up to, I'm technically among those ranks.
            Nowhere near as big but every now and then I'll see some relatively
            big artist like one of my art pieces so I at least know I have my
            foot in the door with the community as a whole. Who knew that simply
            participating in online art spaces would get you some sort of
            notice.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Speaking of online spaces though, I actually recently reached a 300
            follower count milestone on Bluesky and I only noticed how close I
            was just a few days ago. So of course we have to celebrate this sort
            of occassion. I'm going to do a raffle... at some point idk just
            yet. Listen I'm still pretty new here and I need to get some stuff
            worked out first, but I do want to do a raffle. I still have like
            eight more requests to do on top of two more potential projects on
            the horizon and on top of the usual life stuff, but I still want to
            do a raffle dammit, I want to get good at low poly models to where
            it becomes second nature to me. Because I know this has potential of
            some kind for someone like me.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            That aside, I've set a goal to start a raffle the day before the
            Half Off Sale ends, if not sooner... Oh yeah my commissions are
            starting a half the usual price until March 11th. so if you want a
            low poly model of yourself or your friend or anyone's OC for $15 at
            the least, please consider my deal. In general though I'm honestly
            just happy that I'm able to do low poly stuff in the first place...
            like... at all y'know? And if it gets me sime extra money so people
            can't totally say it's useless or futile, I'm doing what I love and
            I'm getting paid for it. That's all that matters to me. (Just saying
            though, I'm still hoping to get a tech job of some kind in the
            future, if you know any openings in the Pacific coast especially
            then please reach out like genuinely I am so tired of being ghosted
            all the freaking time in job application sites and even in person to
            an extent)

          <p>
            Man it has been quite a while since I updated here huh... this is
            absolutely going to hurt my GitHub commit activity... But why the
            long wait? Another hiatus maybe? Nope, me not updating was just an
            unintended side effect of relearning Blockbench to make a low poly
            model on top of an upcoming interview that past week (I did not get
            the job =[ ).
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            So yeah me not landing the job did hurt me a bit, even though I had
            a bit of an expectation that I was just inherently unprepared
            considering it was my first real interview and even though I
            reassured myself that more opportunites would present themselves in
            due time. How did I cope with this? By finishing up a low poly model
            I started on days before the interview, the healthiest coping
            mechanism imaginable.
          </p>
          <div class="flex w-full justify-center h-[100px]">
            <img src="/assets/ace.gif" alt="Low poly gif of Ace sitting" />
          </div>
          <p>
            Really though, after I finished my model it genuinely energized me
            after I was done, and it happened again when I was nearly finished
            with another model. Seems dopamine really is a hell of a chemical
            huh, no wonder humans are super curious, and it's that desire for
            creation that makes me want to do things like programming for a
            living.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Right now though I'm feeling in a better enough mood to go about the
            hunt again. In spite of the hellish conditions in the US there seems
            to be more job openings for programmers and I even got a tip from my
            coding teacher to ensure I land a job. The only issue being that it
            would mean locking myself away in my room to work on a project for
            days on end, not being nearly as efficient akin to whenever I learn
            something new so I need another source of revenue to justify doing
            that in the first place. And since the places I've applied aren't
            calling back so far I've started looking into opening commissions
            for low poly 3D models akin to the one I'm showing right now. I took
            up a handful of requests already and on top of that I still need to
            finish a site for an IRL client.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            In the meantime I'm opening up the art page and will soon convert it
            into an Art/Comm page for people to send request for commissions
            over. When they open up the plan will be to price MOTHER 3 sprites
            at $10 with walk cycles being an extra $2 and low poly models being
            $30. So long as I'm making some sort of income this should be
            sufficient.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="text-xl font-bold">Update Feb 24</p>
          <p>
            I'm preparing a commission sheet right now and I'm going to use this
            site to host my ToS. I also decided to just make art and commissions
            their own pages.

            It is finally done, I have created a walk cycle for every possible
            party member, which can be found in the Roster tab. I even added

            So rotation didn't quite work as well as I would have hoped... I

            Guess it's time I put in some effort and figure out a way to make
            this actually responsive somehow. So far my plan to accomplish this
            involves using the index page as the layout and making pages appear
            in an iframe.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="apple-kid leading-8">
            The only caveat is that CSS breakpoints are now broken this way due
            to the portion reading the iframe rather than the full page. That
            could theoretically be fixed by filling the section via Javascript
            instead, but I don't feel like doing that right now, so we'll stick
            with iframes for now and we'll see how long that will last. Also
            URLs won't function as intended for the time being, but the sidebar
            buttons will work again

            In other news, the job hunt so far has proven somewhat fruitful, I
            went to one open house interview the other day and I think I did
            pretty well. If I'm chosen then they'll call me next week, and if
            not then another one is happening in two weeks, and if neither of
            those work then there's also like four other jobs doing interviews
            on February or March, one of which is more of an assistance program
            than a job. To be honest, I kinda hope I land a position with the
            assistance program if only to simplify my bus trip to just one bus
            ride compared to two with the others, though I'd be satisfied if I
            get a job anywhere at this point..
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="apple-kid leading-8">
            So long as I stop feeling like I'm freeloading and can enjoy things
            again, I'll be satisfied. Hell, I'm satisfied with at least trying,
            but I'll be more satisfied AND paid if I get a proper job. With all
            that being said, remember to take care of yourself, you shouldn't
            stress yourself to the point of burnout or depression, I let it
            happen to me and it was the worst. Remember to enjoy things even if
            you feel a little guilty doing so.

          Now what compelled me to make this look like a near two and a half
          decade old system? ...Honestly I'm not sure, but I'm glad I went this
          route regardless. There's more work to be done but so far this is
          starting to come out pretty good. I, of course, have more plans for
          this site if the new locked out sidebar buttons were any indicator.
          Heck, I even went through and updated the
          <a
            class="text-blue-700 visited:text-purple-700"
            href="/not_found.html"
            >404 page</a
          >
          if you're curious. Right now though it is late, I need to improve my
          sleep schedule and find an actual job (Not to say this doesn't help, I
          update my GitHub every time I update this site) but sometimes I do
          surprise myself with what I come up with.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also added four new buttons to the Graphics Shop if you're
          interested, and I plan to utilize my own personal collection with the
          shop as well at some point.

          One more thing, I recently learned that Neocities styling can be
          weird, where styles won't update normally, instead using cached
          versions if you've visited previously. In this case, I decided to name
          my style "stylebeta.css" so I don't have to make different version
          numbered styles. If you see some weird styling, it's either
          unfinished, or you need to press CTRL + Shift + R to hard refresh and
          clear the cache

                      Hoo boy... trying to make this box here look the way it
                      does while staying consistent was not easy at all... but
                      it was absolutely worth it, I have no regrets. So yeah,
                      another overhaul here, this time the dialogue boxes are
                      much closer to EarthBound, down to the colors chosen. I
                      also grabbed the Apple Kid font one of my friends used on
                      their website to use on here, although I noticed no bullet
                      point glyphs were on the font itself, so I went out of my
                      way to add my own so I can use it myself, while trying to
                      stay as accurate as possible to the games. I know there
                      will be people out there who want to know how to do this,
                      so I made a page dedicated to how you too can make your
                      own EarthBound dialogue boxes, either with HTML alone or
                      by using CSS classes. I've been watching One Piece as
                      well, finished the East Blue arc, and I've come to the
                      absolute conclusion that Luffy is definitely on the
                      spectrum, there's no doubt about that. Anyhow, this won't
                      be the last time this page recieves an overhaul either,
                      I'm going to keep at this website with what I've learned,
                      even if it kills me! (TRANSLATION: even if it's tedious
                      and time consuming as hell!) Background should also be
                      less eyestraining*, I was told I should do that for the
                      sake of others.
                      <br />
                      <br />
                      <p class="text-xs motherish">
                        *The background was originally the EarthBound File
                        Select grid in all its eyestrainy small blocky brightly
                        colored glory made worse with how the background could
                        scroll alongside it. The background you see now with the
                        big blocks and softer colors that's locked in the
                        background was made as a result of someone warning me
                        about potential danger so thanks for the heads-up even
                        after all these years later

                      <br />

                      I need to find a way to better journal this, I commented
                      my previous update text out, but I also don't want to
                      trash it completely either, plus I want others to be able
                      to read it. I'll find a way, but for now I should mention
                      that I'll be updating this website a bit more regularly
                      for smaller things. I also feel like I should make a blog
                      page to put my previous update text. Anyhow, school's
                      going fine, I'm still enjoying One Piece, and overall
                      things are fairly stable. Hell, I feel more awake now ever
                      since I've started getting into this whole coding school
                      thing. Feel free to look around, not much was added
                      compared to the previous version though.

                      <br />
                      <br />

                      ...Y'know I really should work on the alt text for this
                      site's images, and I should really learn how to make that
                      alt text good.

                      scratch that, an entirely new site from sratch is overdue,
                      I can't work like this anymore, there's too much that I
                      learned at this point, this site has charm but is also
                      severely lacking. But I won't wipe the site completely,
                      and I won't leave it completely abandoned. I'll update the
                      site some more until I'm able to make a brand new one. Too
                      tired to decorate portfolio page now, will do at some

            around to updating my website after neglecting it for so long, I
            suppose obligaton is a good motivation in some cases. And oh wow,
            what an overhaul it is, this thing used to just be a list of art and
            now it has pages and junk. There's certainly more I wish to do here,
            and hopefully the higher powers of CSS will be kind to me. Will it
            be hell to work with? Maybe, but at least I can see the changes
            instantly... for now at least, and hoo boy do I feel like Javascript
            will throw a wrench at things when I get to it. Regardless I hope to
            really spruce up this site because I can't live like this forever...

          Welcome to my art gallery! There's barely anything here at the moment,
          so far I've only sorted through my art by recognizable dates,
          everything else is in the unsorted category and lacks the QOL
          attributes that the sorted pieces have, but I'm glad to have made this
          regardless, especially since this is my first time working with HTML

          just smething that comes with aging and getting better. Surely I'll
          have the same effect with this page, but as of right now, I'm still
          glad to have made this page. Note that some pieces lack titles and
          even alt text, but don't worry I'll come around to it when I update
          again. I hope to expand this more sometime, and I hope you see the
          progress as well. =)

          You may notice that there is a cat following your cursor/finger now...

          Welcome to my art gallery! It took quite some time but I got most of
          the alt text out of the way, however I hope to finish applying alt
          text to all my art before I move on to trying out new things. Some of
          the alt text will likely be changed overtime to better suit things,
          and there will be more to add here so stay tuned. I hope to expand
          this more sometime, and I hope you see the progress as well. =)
