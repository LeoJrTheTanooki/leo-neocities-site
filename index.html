              Artists My Beloved + Commissions Open Again

              <p>
                If you saw some guy in a Luffy cosplay wearing glasses and a
                Luffy pin holding the strap on the Straw Hat together, that was
                me.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                What do you do when you get paid big cash for working throughout
                an entire month? Make poor financial decisions is what. And my
                way of making those decisions came in the form of a local
                convention I went to this month. In all seriousness, it was
                genuinely such a fun experience not only being around various
                other nerds, having people recognize me as Luffy, and calling
                every other Luffy there "Bon-Clay" and "Bon-Chan" (peak
                character btw, so glad she's in a lot of the games) but also
                because of the artists that were around. Only now did it fully
                set in that I was not the only one around my area making cool
                art, and I'm so glad there were so many other artist checking
                this convention out. I took my sister along as well, and she had
                a great time, buying some stuff of her own.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Something that I had considered doing at other conventions was
                to try and talk to the artists who were at their alleys, or at
                least talk to them more... but honestly I felt like I would come
                off as creepy if I were to try that... but I still wanted to
                show my support to their craft, so I just went and bought a
                bunch of stickers, pins and keychains from them instead, that
                way I could at least financially support them. But this time, I
                decided to try and show my art at least and I got a lot of
                lovely reactions from so many artists. Many praised my work
                which really boosted my confidence in my own abilities for one
                thing, which I felt was really needed after my whole episode of
                constantly wondering "what exactly am I good for...?" for a good
                couple of months there. The best part was how my sister got
                inspired to share her art as well and she got a lot of praise as
                well for everything she had done. Two encouraged me to make a
                game with my skills, one asked why me and my sister didn't have
                a table set up, I let some artists know about a local shop that
                sells stickers, keychains and other knick-knacks made by local
                artists, and one let me in on a local sticker maker in return. I
                also found an artist who made Divorced Dofladile (Doflamingo X
                Crocodile but divorced) keychains and earrings and I decided to
                introduce them to MelonTeee, mainly because I had a strong
                feeling her videos would resonate with them, sweetening up the
                deal by mentioning how she's a lesbian ZoSan (Zoro X Sanji)
                shipper, so her opinions can certainly be trusted.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Besides those artists though, I also ran into a few comic
                artists, some who have worked on the industry for a long time
                and some who went and launched their own comics. I bought two
                graphic novels, one about a zombie apocalypse but with Disney
                styled cats called

                booth. There was another person who did tarot readings, and
                figured "Yeah sure, why not get a reading while I'm here". The
                first time I truly learned about tarot cards was through Persona
                5 and I've held some respect for them since then, reading a bit
                more about the cards and where else they appeared in other
                media, but this was my first time getting a proper reading. So I
                sat down, decided that I would let the cards do their thing
                without my input and watched as the fortune teller did their
                thing with their Fallout themed tarot deck. And y'know what? The
                cards read me pretty freaking well. They correctly read my
                passion for the jobs I held, the fact that I wear my heart on my
                sleeve but also have difficulty expressing myself, and the fact
                that I had recently developed feelings for someone... then they
                told me that 18 is my important number for fate... So that was
                an experience, we'll have to see if anything happens on the 18th
                of this month. I had a few other minor experiences happen as
                well, such as someone giving me a Luffy sticker they bought
                because of my cosplay and the fact that I ran into the same
                Scott Pilgrim and Ramona Flowers cosplayers three times during
                the day. I high fived both of them during the third time while
                we were leaving lol.

                while he complimented my cosplay (He didn't know who Luffy was
                but he liked his fit). Sean and some other voice actors actually
                did a panel and mentioned how companies especially like to hire
                voice actors that people are passionate about and y'know Sean...
                I gotta say... I'm very passionate about voice actors, I'm so
                glad they exist to breathe so much life into all sorts of
                characters, I get excited whenever I hear a familiar voice come
                out of a character's mouth, and I love hearing about everything
                that goes into voice acting. In spite of all that though, voice
                actors are criminally underrated and I strongly feel that they
                deserve so mucn better. Sean I may have flubbed up my words with
                you, especially the first time, but it's because I've heard you
                in so many characters and I just didn't know where to begin or
                what to say to someone like you. You may see yourself as some
                average guy, at least that's the vibe I get from so many other
                voice actors, but regardless... thank you for being so kind and
                patient to this awkward Luffy-cosplaying guy. You made his day.

                Ah yeah, commissions are also open once again, recently finished
                one up too. $45 as a starting price. Ya want more info, check
                out the Commissions tab. I styled the sheet after older fighting
                games in the 3D era because I thought the look of those games
                had a lot of charm to it, and also because I figured a mockup
                character select screen would be much smaller and less of a pain
                to deal with compared to my first sheet.

                by my side (What that update was originally gonna be about, got

                  To think I would use this more... alas, I once again had other
                  things at hand to deal with. So I'm just going to say it, I've
                  been put through the wringer mentally for the past couple of
                  months. Low self image issues, failing to reach milestones at
                  my age, inability to get a job, a constant feeling as if I was
                  wasting my time and life. And the constant executive
                  dysfunctional moments sure didn't do any sort of help
                  whatsoever, in fact those moments that were frequent were the
                  biggest plague upon my psyche as it was used as fuel to be
                  further berated, making me feel like the biggest freeloader
                  around which further fueled my own self pity and guilt which
                  further went and fueled my depression which I had developed
                  throughout my period of unemployment
                  <span class="font-bold"
                    >because a bright future in a career space that seemed like
                    the only feasible job for me and my mind had eroded into
                    nothing by the time I was ready to enter that career field
                    and not even the minimum wage jobs around my area was
                    answering me back at all, with my efforts to go in person as
                    suggested leading to the same answers such as "We're hiring
                    in a month or two or next season", or "Just check our
                    website"
                    <span class="italic">
                      and the information that I was given being the fact that
                      every applicant for those jobs are basically chosen by
                      raffle and everywhere I looked online everyone else
                      struggles with unemployment and ghost jobs sure didn't
                      help me see any sort of light at all and in fact made me
                      believe that I was caved in this miserable tunnel simply
                      due to outside circumstances

                  Yeah I was... told a lot of things throughout the time, I may
                  be overexaggerating things but almost no one contacted me back
                  in spite of how much I could muster up the ability to try, I
                  only got contacted thrice... ever... One turned out to be a
                  scam that shut down my bank account cause I nearly fell for it
                  like a dumbass, the other turned out to be a pyramid scheme
                  with some health insurance thing and the last I just straight
                  up bombed, all out of like 200 jobs I applied to. I only
                  lucked out with my current job simply because I arrived at the
                  location at the right place at the right time and the boss
                  recognized me from a party her daughter had hosted for the
                  coding school we attended. I got it on the spot. It's more of
                  an odd job where I help to run a game trailer to bookings just
                  ensuring things run smoothly and resolve any issues that arise
                  but everyone there including my bosses seem to like me... for
                  who I am??? Genuinely a wild concept ay that point, yeah I
                  know pretty sad that that of all things was wild to me but
                  being called a freak strange p***y f****t weirdo dumbass
                  r[EDACTED] sure didn't help even if he didn't mean it or was
                  just "playing around" sure made me feel unlovable wow who
                  would've thunk.
                  <span class="line-through">
                    To give credit where credit is due, he did help with getting
                    an electric bike and fixing some things around the house and
                    forced me to get out more which I did need, but still.
                  </span>
                  Nah screw that, after responding to a couple of questions he
                  had about my future with "I don't know" which translates to "I
                  know damn well you're gonna go and push me down with some
                  negatively cynical bigoted ass crap that's still rooted in
                  reality so I won't be able to argue back regardless if I give
                  you a valid response so I'm not gonna say jack" and then
                  threatening to kick me out of the house at 25 (as if I could
                  in this economy), I'm just gonna move in with my secondary
                  support system when I learn to drive, even if it means I'll be
                  living with less. I've done it for this past month already and
                  they've been nothing but supportive to me, hell even when I
                  was unemployed they've shown unconditional love and support,
                  reminding me that I'm always welcome in their house no matter
                  what.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  All that being said, I'm glad to have some new people to lean
                  on, and the reminder that I'll always have a secondary support
                  system should my primary one fall for any reason is nice. I've
                  also been offered to work even further with my bosses beyond
                  my current position in the company to do coding stuff so I
                  think I'll stick around with them further to see what goes on.
                  And even if that fails and the berating continues, then at
                  least I'll have another support system that understands that
                  things come at their own time rather than one that puts
                  constant pressure with little encouragement.

              Commissions Are Open For Business
            </h1>
            <div class="m-2">
              <p>
                Yup, it's official, I will create you things if you pay me.
                After waiting so long for some sort of call back from a variety
                of places, I decided to take financial matters of some form into
                my own hands. The Art and about Pages may be completely generic
                and barebones but goddamn did I deck the hell out my Commissions
                page. Then again with that I at least had a frame of reference
                in the form of my commission sheet, which that itself was an
                entire beast which i had to try and figure out with how
                ambitious yet big the gif size was. Like it's a work of art to
                me but too much of a work of art for other sites to handle
                (33MB) and not to mention even when I finally got the gif
                compressed enough to where it looked fine on the surface, it was
                indeed not fine when I sent it into Discord. I may have to make
                a new static version of the image in this case.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                As for the commissions themselves, I've honestly been wanting to
                do commissions for a while now but I've never had the reach nor
                the experience necessary to tackle such things until now. Not
                only that but the number is also growing at a steady pace the
                more I casually post my art and shitposts. It... makes me feel
                seen y'know... like these cool people I look up to, I'm
                technically among those ranks. Nowhere near as big but every now
                and then I'll see some relatively big artist like one of my art
                pieces so I at least know I have my foot in the door with the
                community as a whole. Who knew that simply participating in
                online art spaces would get you some sort of notice.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Speaking of online spaces though, I actually recently reached a
                300 follower count milestone on Bluesky and I only noticed how
                close I was just a few days ago. So of course we have to
                celebrate this sort of occassion. I'm going to do a raffle... at
                some point idk just yet. Listen I'm still pretty new here and I
                need to get some stuff worked out first, but I do want to do a
                raffle. I still have like eight more requests to do on top of
                two more potential projects on the horizon and on top of the
                usual life stuff, but I still want to do a raffle dammit, I want
                to get good at low poly models to where it becomes second nature
                to me. Because I know this has potential of some kind for
                someone like me.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                That aside, I've set a goal to start a raffle the day before the
                Half Off Sale ends, if not sooner... Oh yeah my commissions are
                starting a half the usual price until March 11th. so if you want
                a low poly model of yourself or your friend or anyone's OC for
                $15 at the least, please consider my deal. In general though I'm
                honestly just happy that I'm able to do low poly stuff in the
                first place... like... at all y'know? And if it gets me sime
                extra money so people can't totally say it's useless or futile,
                I'm doing what I love and I'm getting paid for it. That's all
                that matters to me. (Just saying though, I'm still hoping to get
                a tech job of some kind in the future, if you know any openings
                in the Pacific coast especially then please reach out like
                genuinely I am so tired of being ghosted all the freaking time
                in job application sites and even in person to an extent)

                Man it has been quite a while since I updated here huh... this
                is absolutely going to hurt my GitHub commit activity... But why
                the long wait? Another hiatus maybe? Nope, me not updating was
                just an unintended side effect of relearning Blockbench to make
                a low poly model on top of an upcoming interview that past week
                (I did not get the job =[ ).
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                So yeah me not landing the job did hurt me a bit, even though I
                had a bit of an expectation that I was just inherently
                unprepared considering it was my first real interview and even
                though I reassured myself that more opportunites would present
                themselves in due time. How did I cope with this? By finishing
                up a low poly model I started on days before the interview, the
                healthiest coping mechanism imaginable.
              </p>

                <img src="/assets/ace.gif" alt="Low poly gif of Ace sitting" />
              </div>
              <p>
                Really though, after I finished my model it genuinely energized
                me after I was done, and it happened again when I was nearly
                finished with another model. Seems dopamine really is a hell of
                a chemical huh, no wonder humans are super curious, and it's
                that desire for creation that makes me want to do things like
                programming for a living.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Right now though I'm feeling in a better enough mood to go about
                the hunt again. In spite of the hellish conditions in the US
                there seems to be more job openings for programmers and I even
                got a tip from my coding teacher to ensure I land a job. The
                only issue being that it would mean locking myself away in my
                room to work on a project for days on end, not being nearly as
                efficient akin to whenever I learn something new so I need
                another source of revenue to justify doing that in the first
                place. And since the places I've applied aren't calling back so
                far I've started looking into opening commissions for low poly
                3D models akin to the one I'm showing right now. I took up a
                handful of requests already and on top of that I still need to
                finish a site for an IRL client.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                In the meantime I'm opening up the art page and will soon
                convert it into an Art/Comm page for people to send request for
                commissions over. When they open up the plan will be to price
                MOTHER 3 sprites at $10 with walk cycles being an extra $2 and
                low poly models being $30. So long as I'm making some sort of
                income this should be sufficient.
              </p>

              <p>
                I'm preparing a commission sheet right now and I'm going to use
                this site to host my ToS. I also decided to just make art and
                commissions their own pages.

              Friendship ended with Rotation Styling, now iframe is my best

              <p class="apple-kid leading-8">
                So rotation didn't quite work as well as I would have hoped... I
                tried my best to be <del>lazy</del> efficient with how I wanted
                this console to look on mobile, but alas rotation treated the
                screen sizes weird and so I had to scrap it.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p class="apple-kid leading-8">
                Guess it's time I put in some effort and figure out a way to
                make this actually responsive somehow. So far my plan to
                accomplish this involves using the index page as the layout and
                making pages appear in an iframe.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p class="apple-kid leading-8">
                The only caveat is that CSS breakpoints are now broken this way
                due to the portion reading the iframe rather than the full page.
                That could theoretically be fixed by filling the section via
                Javascript instead, but I don't feel like doing that right now,
                so we'll stick with iframes for now and we'll see how long that
                will last. Also URLs won't function as intended for the time
                being, but the sidebar buttons will work again
              </p>
              <br />
              <p class="apple-kid leading-8">
                In other news, the job hunt so far has proven somewhat fruitful,
                I went to one open house interview the other day and I think I
                did pretty well. If I'm chosen then they'll call me next week,
                and if not then another one is happening in two weeks, and if
                neither of those work then there's also like four other jobs
                doing interviews on February or March, one of which is more of
                an assistance program than a job. To be honest, I kinda hope I
                land a position with the assistance program if only to simplify
                my bus trip to just one bus ride compared to two with the
                others, though I'd be satisfied if I get a job anywhere at this
                point..
              </p>
              <br />
              <p class="apple-kid leading-8">
                So long as I stop feeling like I'm freeloading and can enjoy
                things again, I'll be satisfied. Hell, I'm satisfied with at
                least trying, but I'll be more satisfied AND paid if I get a
                proper job. With all that being said, remember to take care of
                yourself, you shouldn't stress yourself to the point of burnout
                or depression, I let it happen to me and it was the worst.
                Remember to enjoy things even if you feel a little guilty doing
                so.

            <p>
              Now what compelled me to make this look like a near two and a half
              decade old system? ...Honestly I'm not sure, but I'm glad I went
              this route regardless. There's more work to be done but so far
              this is starting to come out pretty good. I, of course, have more
              plans for this site if the new locked out sidebar buttons were any
              indicator. Heck, I even went through and updated the
              <a
                class="text-blue-700 visited:text-purple-700"
                href="/not_found.html"
                >404 page</a
              >
              if you're curious. Right now though it is late, I need to improve
              my sleep schedule and find an actual job (Not to say this doesn't
              help, I update my GitHub every time I update this site) but
              sometimes I do surprise myself with what I come up with.

              I also added four new buttons to the Graphics Shop if you're

              One more thing, I recently learned that Neocities styling can be
              weird, where styles won't update normally, instead using cached
              versions if you've visited previously. In this case, I decided to
              name my style "stylebeta.css" so I don't have to make different
              version numbered styles. If you see some weird styling, it's
              either unfinished, or you need to press CTRL + Shift + R to hard
              refresh and clear the cache

                          <br />
                          Hoo boy... trying to make this box here look the way
                          it does while staying consistent was not easy at
                          all... but it was absolutely worth it, I have no
                          regrets. So yeah, another overhaul here, this time the
                          dialogue boxes are much closer to EarthBound, down to
                          the colors chosen. I also grabbed the Apple Kid font
                          one of my friends used on their website to use on
                          here, although I noticed no bullet point glyphs were
                          on the font itself, so I went out of my way to add my
                          own so I can use it myself, while trying to stay as
                          accurate as possible to the games. I know there will
                          be people out there who want to know how to do this,
                          so I made a page dedicated to how you too can make
                          your own EarthBound dialogue boxes, either with HTML
                          alone or by using CSS classes. I've been watching One
                          Piece as well, finished the East Blue arc, and I've
                          come to the absolute conclusion that Luffy is
                          definitely on the spectrum, there's no doubt about
                          that. Anyhow, this won't be the last time this page
                          recieves an overhaul either, I'm going to keep at this
                          website with what I've learned, even if it kills me!
                          (TRANSLATION: even if it's tedious and time consuming
                          as hell!) Background should also be less
                          eyestraining*, I was told I should do that for the
                          sake of others.

                            *The background was originally the EarthBound File
                            Select grid in all its eyestrainy small blocky
                            brightly colored glory made worse with how the
                            background could scroll alongside it. The background
                            you see now with the big blocks and softer colors
                            that's locked in the background was made as a result
                            of someone warning me about potential danger so

                          <br />

                          I need to find a way to better journal this, I
                          commented my previous update text out, but I also
                          don't want to trash it completely either, plus I want
                          others to be able to read it. I'll find a way, but for
                          now I should mention that I'll be updating this
                          website a bit more regularly for smaller things. I
                          also feel like I should make a blog page to put my
                          previous update text. Anyhow, school's going fine, I'm
                          still enjoying One Piece, and overall things are
                          fairly stable. Hell, I feel more awake now ever since
                          I've started getting into this whole coding school
                          thing. Feel free to look around, not much was added
                          compared to the previous version though.

                          <br />
                          <br />

                          ...Y'know I really should work on the alt text for
                          this site's images, and I should really learn how to
                          make that alt text good.

                          <br />

                          Woe, dropdowns be upon ye.** New year, new
                          opportunities to do dumb crap... is what I would say
                          if I updated this a month ago, my god an update was
                          long overdue... actually scratch that, an entirely new
                          site from sratch is overdue, I can't work like this
                          anymore, there's too much that I learned at this
                          point, this site has charm but is also severely
                          lacking. But I won't wipe the site completely, and I
                          won't leave it completely abandoned. I'll update the
                          site some more until I'm able to make a brand new one.
                          Too tired to decorate portfolio page now, will do at
                          some other point.

                >Welcome to my corner of the internet =]<br /><br />So I finally
                got around to updating my website after neglecting it for so
                long, I suppose obligaton is a good motivation in some cases.
                And oh wow, what an overhaul it is, this thing used to just be a
                list of art and now it has pages and junk. There's certainly
                more I wish to do here, and hopefully the higher powers of CSS
                will be kind to me. Will it be hell to work with? Maybe, but at
                least I can see the changes instantly... for now at least, and
                hoo boy do I feel like Javascript will throw a wrench at things
                when I get to it. Regardless I hope to really spruce up this
                site because I can't live like this forever... there isn't
                enough video game references!</m2

            <p>
              Welcome to my art gallery! There's barely anything here at the
              moment, so far I've only sorted through my art by recognizable
              dates, everything else is in the unsorted category and lacks the
              QOL attributes that the sorted pieces have, but I'm glad to have
              made this regardless, especially since this is my first time
              working with HTML in general. I hope to expand this more sometime,
              and I hope you see the progress as well. =)
            </p>

            <p>Here's the one that inspired me to try this for myself</p>

              Welcome to my art gallery! I've added and sorted through some of
              my art and hoo boy did I cringe at my old art... not that I hate
              it, it's just smething that comes with aging and getting better.
              Surely I'll have the same effect with this page, but as of right
              now, I'm still glad to have made this page. Note that some pieces
              lack titles and even alt text, but don't worry I'll come around to
              it when I update again. I hope to expand this more sometime, and I
              hope you see the progress as well. =)

              Welcome to my art gallery! It took quite some time but I got most
              of the alt text out of the way, however I hope to finish applying
              alt text to all my art before I move on to trying out new things.
              Some of the alt text will likely be changed overtime to better
              suit things, and there will be more to add here so stay tuned. I
              hope to expand this more sometime, and I hope you see the progress
              as well. =)
